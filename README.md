# Bugs

I recently tested a grocery site - a web application - https://qatest-dev.indvp.com/

I used Google Chrome Browser and Windows 8. Except ID B11, here I used Browser Mozilla Firefox to ckecked cross-browser.
I reported the most indicative functional, content, visual, performance and cross-browser bugs in my opinion to show you my skills.
